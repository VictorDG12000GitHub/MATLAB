%MATLAB has two main ways, the command window for quick operations and more
%improvised code, and the scripts, like this one.
x=[1 2 3]
y=[3;2;1]
x*y
%MATLAB is not strong typed, and doesnÂ´t need ;. MATLAB also uses complex
%numbers.
z=sqrt(-9)
%rand() is used to create a matrix of random numbers, the number inside the 
() is the size of the square matrix.
r=rand(1)
%To create this random matrix with another size:
ra=rand(2,5)
%The size of ra is 2 x 5, 2 rows and 5 columns.
